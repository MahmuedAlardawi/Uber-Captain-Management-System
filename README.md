# Uber System Simulation - Project Overview

## Introduction
The Uber System Simulation is a software designed to simulate Uber operations focusing on captain management using a Binary Search Tree (BST) to efficiently handle operations such as adding, searching, and deleting captain records.

## Key Features

- **Binary Search Tree Implementation**: Uses BST to manage captain records, ensuring efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion.
- **Comprehensive Captain Management**: Supports operations like adding new captains, booking rides, finishing rides, and displaying captain information.
- **Interactive Command Handling**: Processes commands from an input file to perform operations like booking and finishing rides, and dynamically updating captain availability and ratings.

## Technical Requirements

- **Data Structure Utilization**: Employs binary search trees to handle complex operations involving captain data.
- **File I/O Operations**: Manages input and output through files, reading commands from `input.txt` and writing outputs to `output.txt`.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Allows dynamic interaction with the data structure through various commands to simulate real-time operations.

## Objective

To demonstrate the use of binary search trees in managing a complex system of records, simulating real-world functionalities of an Uber system for captain management. This project serves as a practical example of applying data structures and algorithms in a simulated environment.

## How to Use

- **Initialization**: Load initial captain data from `input.txt` to populate the BST.
- **Command Processing**: Execute commands from the input file to manage captains and simulate ride operations.

This README provides guidance on setting up and operating the Uber System Simulation, ideal for educational purposes or software development simulations.
